# vitacontroltest
An application for PS Vita that tests inputs, gets system information. Meant to be used as a point of reference for using Unity with PS Vita.

## How to install
1. Download the latest VPK from Releases
2. Transfer that VPK to your PS Vita
3. Install the VPK using VitaShell

## How to build
You will need to set-up Unity to build PS Vita titles. You can do this using the following tutorial: https://www.patreon.com/posts/guide-how-to-to-24906451

If you are a Windows user then you won't have any problems. If you are a macOS user (like me), then you can either BootCamp your Mac, or use a virtual machine like Parallels Desktop (what I'm using). For Linux users, you should either run a VM or install Windows in a separate volume.

The tutorial above also includes instructions on how to build your Unity PS Vita projects. This repo doesn't require anything special, so you can build this using those instructions.
